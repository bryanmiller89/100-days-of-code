# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 3, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I am not going to count Day 0, as this was the day I decided to pursue the challenge and research it.

**Thoughts**: I am hoping this will be a very impactful challange. While most treat it as purely coding, I will be treating it as a 100DaysOfCode and 100DaysOfJobSearching. I graduated from a coding program so I will also use this time to advance my coding skills as well as securing my first developer job.

### Day 1: September 4, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Specifically HTML5, CSS3, and Applied Visual Design. I feel like I am weak in my design/styling ability, so I wanted to go over fundamental topics to solidify my understanding.

**Thoughts** I brushed up on things I already knew but also was re-introduced to things I was not entirely familiar with, such as pseudo-classes in CSS. Went through and finished the JS section as well. Object bracket notion was surprisingly giving me some trouble to access certain properties on objects. This definitely helped my previously knowledge on the topic.

### Day 2: September 5, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed CSS Flexbox and played around with CSS grid system for the first time. Went over media queries for changing browser page based on different viewport sizes. Looked over the CSS properties needed to make images on a webpage responsive and scale when resizing the browser window.

**Thoughts** CSS Flexbox was a topic I was already introduced to but wanted to go over since I feel like I stumble a lot on the design aspect of my projects. I never learned the CSS grids before so that was nice to discover as an alternative. I was familiar with media queries and responsive design properties but, again, I wanted to go over them to reinforce my understanding of the topics.
